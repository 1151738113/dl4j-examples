 * Please run "FeaturizeVGG16NoTop" first
 *  where images in the animals dataset are featurized with vgg16-notop (imported from keras configs) and saved to separate train and test folders
 *
 * Here we train a simple MLP classifier on this data to demonstrate transfer learning with a previously trained model
 *
 * This example is inspired by Francois Chollet's blog post on building powerful classifiers with very little data
